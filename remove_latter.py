#Your goal is to write a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string.
#Important: Your function should handle strings of any length ≥ 2 characters. For strings with exactly 2 characters, return an empty string.

# Function to remove first and last character
def remove_chars(s):
    return s[1:-1]
# Input
s = input("Enter string: ")
# Output
print("Result:", remove_chars(s))
